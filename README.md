Edit the var SITE_FOLDER at line 10 to your main folder

Move this script to a folder of your preference, let's say something like: /Users/USERNAME/Sites/automations/sh-virtualHost.sh

Add a shortcut to your sh: sudo echo "alias AddVirtualHost='/Users/USERNAME/Sites/automations/sh-virtualHost.sh'" >> ~/.bash_profile

restart terminal

And now all you need to do is call it by typing: **AddVirtualHost** on the terminal
